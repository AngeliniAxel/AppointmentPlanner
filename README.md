# AppointmentPlanner

This is a Codecademy project that gives you a sort of requirements which describe the project youâ€™ll be building. 
The idea is to work with work with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks to create an App
that consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.
